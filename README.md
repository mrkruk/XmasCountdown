# XmasCountdown
A Christmas Countdown program for Arduino boards and 32x64 RGB Matrix panel 

**Does not use an actual clock - you must set the amount of time remaining before Christmas Day**  

This is a standalone, no internet needed, no clock needed, countdown timer.  

Power to the board must be provided for the countdown to maintain its values - either via USB to the board, or external power adapter to the board.  Once you plug in the board, the countdown begins.  If power is lost or otherwise disconnected, the countdown values must be set to end the countdown at midnight, when Christmas Day begins.

The RGB matrix panel requires its own 5v power supply.
