# XmasCountdown
A Christmas Countdown program for Arduino boards and 32x64 RGB Matrix panel 

Power to the board must be provided for the countdown to maintain its values - either via USB to the board, or external power adapter to the board.  If power is lost or otherwise disconnected, the countdown values must be set to end the countdown at midnight when Christmas Day begins.

The panel requires its own 5v power supply, which if desired could be turned on and off with a timer on the outlet.
